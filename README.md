# <My-Tasks>

## Description

My motivation to build this project was to keep tasks organized. Red is for overdue, yellow is upcoming & white is more time to do.
I built this to help create a place to organize tasks.
This problem solved an issue where someone may have that they don‚Äôt have a planner or notebook to write their tasks.
I learned how to make different colors for time amount for the tasks.
